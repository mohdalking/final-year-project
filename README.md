Finding a job is an effort that is usually done by adults to find a new job to earn a salary. A large number of communities in third world countries, are suffering from an unemployment crisis and difficulty getting jobs in line with skills. Many graduates also find it difficult to find jobs that match their expertise and studies and result in unemployment. So, after many attempts to find the right job but failed, they had to take jobs that were far away from their field of study as well as temporary jobs. In this project, an Android application was developed specifically for the general public looking for temporary or part -time job information. It focuses on the need for a quick way to find replacement workers or short -term employment. The app provides a list of jobs that match the skills and information entered by the job seeker. This apps also have several modules such as register, log in, manage user information add job, modify job, search job and rate job. The application was developed with a prototype methodology. Android Studio software is for application development. The project aims to deliver a better platform that helps both workers to find short term job and job owners to find employers.
